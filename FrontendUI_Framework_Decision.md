 ## Astro 
 - Simplicity and blazingly fast reloads at its core. Suited for content rich websites. We can work with our ui framework of choice while shipping zero JS to the client.
 
 ## Svelte
 - Its the most loved UI framework. 
 - Better js logic handling built in than astro.
 - More suitable over nextJS when the bakend cannot be intertwinned with the frontend eg Use of different tech stacks
 - Might require a separate server for the backend .
 - Integrates seamlessly with tanstack features including tanstack queries and tanstack tables.
 - Its definately lighter than next and suitable for apps requiring some level of interactivity which is hard to achieve using astro but also not so much that using nextjs might be an overkill.
 
 ## NextJS 
 - Mature version of react
 - Easy to migrate existing enterprise projects to it. 
 - Offeres blazingly fast reloads like astro. 
 - With server actions mutations have been simplified. 
 - With server actions , frontend and backend code can be intertwinned all under one roof ,  processed then the data sent to client. Will be building the church and elearning app with it. 
 - No need for react query as data handling is inbuilt and works quite seemlessly.
 
 ## PARTING SHOT
 - All my enteprise level applications might be using nextjs 
 - NextJS and Svelte are almost similar. The deal breaker being server actions with which it is possible for backend and frontend to coexist in one server.
 - Svelte offers a better dev experience but well , I am well conversant with the two. Functionality is my deal breaker.
