## OPTION 1 : MONGODB ATLAS
- No need to look for a server ..... Backend is offered as a full service.
- The serveless option is for those frontend applications which do not have an intermediary server....
- Have really friendly pricing features based on documents instead of projects 

## OPTION 2 : POCKET BASE

- Pocket base uses the SQL lite database , doesn't come with its own hosting , thought authentication is seamless.
- Offers a software as a service but we will be the ones to look for the server.
- Streamlines the authentication process making it seamless.

## OPTION 3 : SUPABASE
- My next learning option.
- We can set up two free projects...
- Free projects are not condusive for production applications which require backups
- Supabase uses SQL to configure servers , charge $25 per per project per month.
- Data displayed in table format.... Really nice!
