An admin dashboard for an elearning module should provide a comprehensive overview of the system's performance and user activity. Here are some additional visualizations and information you can consider displaying on your admin dashboard:

1. **Course Enrollment Over Time:**
   Show how course enrollments have changed over time. This can help administrators identify popular courses and trends in student preferences.

2. **User Activity Metrics:**
   Display metrics like login frequency, average time spent per session, and the most active users. This can help administrators identify engaged users and inactive accounts.

3. **Unit and Chapter Completion Rates:**
   Visualize how many students have completed each unit and chapter. This can help instructors and administrators track the progress of students and identify any challenging sections.

4. **Lesson Engagement:**
   Show which lessons have the highest engagement rates (views, time spent). This can help instructors identify effective teaching materials and adjust content that's not resonating well.

5. **Resource Downloads:**
   Display the number of times lesson resources (notes, files, etc.) have been downloaded. This can help gauge the usefulness of supplementary materials.

6. **Discussion Activity:**
   If you have a discussion forum or chat feature, display the number of posts, comments, and replies. This can help administrators understand the level of interaction among users.

7. **User Feedback and Ratings:**
   If your platform allows users to rate courses or lessons, display the average ratings and comments. This can provide insight into user satisfaction and areas for improvement.

8. **Course Completion Rates:**
   Show the percentage of enrolled students who have completed each course. This can help administrators identify course effectiveness and areas that need improvement.

9. **Support Requests:**
   Display the number of support requests submitted by users and their resolution status. This can help administrators manage user issues and track response times.

10. **Platform Performance:**
    Display key performance indicators like server response time, uptime percentage, and any recent incidents. This helps ensure the platform is running smoothly.

11. **User Demographics:**
    If you collect user demographic data, you could display a breakdown of users by age, gender, location, etc. This can help administrators understand their user base better.

12. **Tutor Performance:**
    If you have multiple tutors, you could display metrics like student ratings, response times to student queries, and number of active courses.

13. **Upcoming Events and Announcements:**
    Highlight upcoming events, webinars, deadlines, or important announcements for users.

14. **Data on Popular Devices and Browsers:**
    Show what devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) and browsers users are accessing the platform with. This can help optimize the platform for the most commonly used configurations.

Remember, the key is to provide insights that empower administrators to make informed decisions. Make sure the visualizations are clear, interactive, and actionable. Also, consider allowing administrators to customize their dashboard to some extent based on their preferences and priorities.
