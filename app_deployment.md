## OPTION 1 : MONGODB ATLAS
- Best suited for enterprise level applications , its cheaper to get started with with a very generous free tier where we can scale as we go.
- No need to look for a server ..... Backend is offered as a full service.
- The serveless option is for those frontend applications which do not have an intermediary server....
- Have really friendly pricing features based on documents instead of projects 

## OPTION 2 : POCKET BASE
- Suitable for simple applications , no scree shots of data hence fragile....
- Pocket base uses the SQL lite database , doesn't come with its own hosting , thought authentication is seamless.
- Offers a software as a service but we will be the ones to look for the server.
- Streamlines the authentication process making it seamless.

## OPTION 3 : SUPABASE
- Yet to figure out its usecase... May be suitable for big projects which require a good amount of storage for files and data eg mess application or the rent application while managing big applications with lots of users. I believe it also makes authentication seemless...
- My next learning option.
- We can set up two free projects...
- Free projects are not condusive for production applications which require backups
- Supabase uses SQL to configure servers , charge $25 per per project per month.
- Data displayed in table format.... Really nice!

NB
- When i am able to set up my authentication system, it will not be a big consideration while choosing a DB since i can do it myself!
