Genericss is a feature that allows s to provide specific types for the data returned by the queries and mutations.

Example 
 `const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery<UserData>('user', fetchUserData);` The `<userData>`  is the generic parameter that you're providing to the useQuery hook. It specifies the type of data that the query is expected to return. This helps TypeScript understand the shape of the data and provides type checking and inference based on that type.
