## OPTION 1 : MONGODB ATLAS
- MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based database service provided by MongoDB, Inc. 
- It is primarily built around the MongoDB database management system, which is a NoSQL, document-oriented database. 
- MongoDB is designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data in the form of JSON-like documents. MongoDB Atlas makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale MongoDB clusters in the cloud. It's a popular choice for applications requiring flexibility, scalability, and fast development cycles.
- No need to look for a server ..... The database is offered as a full cloud service.
- The serveless option is for those frontend applications which do not have a backend but still wanna enjoy database functionalities.
- Have really friendly pricing features based on documents instead of projects , the database is manage for me on the cloud , good stuff.

## OPTION 2 : POCKET BASE

- Pocket base uses the SQL lite database , doesn't come with its own hosting , thought authentication is seamless.
- Offers a software as a service but we will be the ones to look for the server.
- Streamlines the authentication process making it seamless.

## OPTION 3 : SUPABASE (MY NEXT LEARNING OPTION)
- Supabase is an open-source platform that provides a set of tools and services for building applications with a focus on the backend. 
- Supabase utilizes PostgreSQL as its underlying database management system.
- PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database system that offers a wide range of features and is known for its reliability and extensibility. ---
- Supabase adds a layer of functionality on top of PostgreSQL, including authentication, real-time capabilities, and API generation, to simplify backend development.

- We can set up two free projects...
- Free projects are not condusive for production applications which require backups
- Supabase uses SQL to configure servers , charge $25 per per project per month.
- Data displayed in table format.... Really nice!
